# Programs

Hi Im Jan. A newbie student who didnt even bother to goto School well you know I might have ways or tricks on my Sleve but
Sometimes being lazy is what I do most

So for this repository i will be commiting everything I code just for back up
This repository might be usefull soon or maybe not but who knows maybe I cann pull this trick.

# Learning 

What I leanred on school is nothing but to pass the exam. Theres no holy grail its just me that realize having a teacher is a second option
to be exactly as it is.

Take new Highs and lows dont smoke weed but cigarrets.

#Purpose 

On this Repository I dont intend to leak or promote laziness but to help others I need. The problem is when everything gets easier the more
the person meets the qualifications of being stubborn. This repository serve as the ground of reliable codes throught out the lessons of our 
school.
